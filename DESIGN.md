### Design

The play area consists of three zones. The bottom-most zone is your play area, the middle zone is no man's land and the top zone is the play area of the opponent. Each player is restricted to their own area and both can enter no man's land. You can move your player with either the directional keys or the WASD keys. Each player can fire projectiles in the direction of the mouse cursor by pressing the left mouse button or the space bar. The objective is to hit the opponent with projectiles until all of their health is depleted. The player who achieved this objective first is the winner.
